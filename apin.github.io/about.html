                    <h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
                    <p>I'm Apisegan Nagarajah, a passionate BTM Student with the idea of making a difference in the IT field.
                         I specialize in skills like Excel, Python, and Java and enjoy creating projects. 
                         Apart from the technical aspect, I have many hobbies which I love to do on a daily basis. 
                         One for which is dancing and working out daily. 
                         I am a prime believer that our mental health extremely benefits from our physical acitivity.
                         So working out and staying fit has always pushed me to be active in other duties. 
                         Dancing is a hobby I grasped since the age of 7, and have been dancing since. 
                         This hobby not only kept me active, but it also allowed me to understand certain characteristics of music and allow room for my creativity in short time. 
                         Dancing has also taught me many skills like, independency, responsibility, time management, and built my confidence to a point where I can lead a team.
                         I strongly believe that the skills I have learnt through my dancing journey, can help push my dedication towards the modern workforce.
